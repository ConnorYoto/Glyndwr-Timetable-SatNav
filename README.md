# Glyndwr-Timetable-SatNav
A Dissertation Project looking into the feasibility of an indoor navigation android app with timetable wayfinding within a university campus.

Developed using Indoor Atlas (this is super useful!!! >> https://github.com/IndoorAtlas), this was a surprisingly accurate Indoor Navigational tool. 

A video demo of this particular app in use can be seen here - https://youtu.be/EQhVYRDoZek. Bear in mind, I am by no means a good video editor or any good at filming.
